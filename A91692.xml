            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE RESOLUTION Of the County of KENT.</head>
            <p>WArr hath deeply plunged this land into the misery of a Civill destruction, so that the cleerest Judgment cannot discerne, what should be the event thereof. For both Armies being provided of great strength, they flatter themselves with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of victory, the losse and effusion of bloud being certaine, the gaine nothing but the ruin of the Common-wealth, under a pretended shew of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, which doth perswade the acting of the blou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Tragedy. In these doubtfull, times no County can stand as a looker on, but must declare theit Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution either to stand for the King or Parliament, so that the affections of the Commons are now cleer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly discerned, and in this doubtfull matter are disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered either to be friends or foes; their hearts by their inclination, to either side being laid naked to view of the world.</p>
            <p>That which shall now be the subject of this Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, is the constant Resolution of the <hi>Kentish</hi> men, whose cleere intents do give example to other coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:156252:3"/> to be firme and true with themselves and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion which now lies a bleeding.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Kentish</hi>-men were formerly conduced by their owne opinions, to thinke it the safest course to stand upon their owne guard, or else to assist the King in this civill War, their Petitions not being so well accepted as those of other Counties presented to the Parliament, so that it was supposed that upon any occasion they would raise forces to assist the King, and with all the aide they could afford him, encrease the flame of this Civill dissention.</p>
            <p>Now the <hi>Kentish</hi> men are happyly converted to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother opinion, thereby giving certaine testemony of a great acknowledging their former errour. And they do now intend to be no more blinded, with a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous shew of standing for the King; but in all matters do addresse their desires to the Parliament, and to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and defend both Houses.</p>
            <p>The causes moving forward a designe, and the good end whereunto any action is directed, do make it perfect and worthy of glory, if therefore the reader would consider the cause, and end, exciting the <hi>Ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish</hi>-men to this Resolution, he shall finde they wete ind<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ed thereunto by the perswasion of Religion and Re<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>son, they saw their could be no Reformation of the Church, unlesse they complyed with the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and therefore they sent a late Petition to the Parliament, which gave them better satisfaction then the former did, desiring that the Parliament would be pleased to go on to a through Reformation, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other good desires they intimated in that Petition
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:156252:3"/> shewing how much they desired to expedite their proceedings, and in many high expressions declared their Resolution, and constant affection to the Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament.</p>
            <p>Religion and the sacred care thereof, was the first strong inducement to worke this happy change in their affections, and now have made a late demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of their firme love to stand for the truth, and and those great defenders thereof the Parliament, they having now as ardent a desire, to advance the common cause, as those other Counties; who made more early adresse to the house.</p>
            <p>The next consideration that begot in them a good opinion of the Parliament, was the inhumane deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the C<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>valiers, unto which the <hi>Turkish</hi> slavery being compared would appeare mercy, they have their eares strook with the terrour of their bloudy actions, their pillaging and plundering of houses, their extreame cruelty to such as they take, tortur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them with words, before they will afford them the happynesse of an expected death; thereby to lengthen their misery, and to rejoyce at their owne wickednesse, in Sacrificeing the liues of all they take, and killing Weomen with child, thinkeing it to be a worke of Divelish pollicy to kill a Round-head.</p>
            <p>What Souldiers heart though obdurate as <hi>Vlisses Mirmidons,</hi> can seeing these most bloudy and treacherous crueltyes refraine from teares,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:156252:4"/> teares, to know and behold so many butcheryes daily by them committed.</p>
            <p>These <hi>Kentish</hi> men wisely pondring and weighing this unnaturall cruelty, have forsaken the Cavaliers and both condemned them and their actions. Now they have forsooke those flattering perswasions of exposing their lives and fortunes, amongst the rabble of roaring Cavaliers, and have given themselves up to serve the King and Parliament, in such manner as their consciences do guide them with the light of a pure zeale. In this they shew that they were never conquered, because no bad or private respects could subdue them to an obedience against the Common-wealth; but all our strength shall be imployed to the desire of our Religious and honourable Parliament. The <hi>Kentish</hi> men are a people that are sooner drawne by gentle meanes then any way enforced, their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection must flow uncompelled, and their former standing off, or coldnesse in the great affaires of the Common-wealth is now grown strong in ardent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires, earnest wishes, and actuall expositions of their affection to the Parliament, what a strange alteration hath some few Moneths wrought; <hi>Kent</hi> was then supposed to be for the King, but for the Parliament now, they will vindicate the Parliaments Priviledges, they desire now (as all others true subjects do) that there may be peace betweene the King and Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and that the wounds of this War may be hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and not by the hand of Delinquents opened rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to bleed unto destruction.</p>
            <p>They have beheld the Kingdomes distractions, and htiw bleeding hearts suffered in the misery that hath
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:156252:4"/> fallen upon this Common-Wealth, they know that Religion is that sacred knot which neither great <hi>Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xander</hi> nor any King can cut asunder, but there will follow a generall dissolution of all government, and this land be converted into the first principles of heathen barbarisme, or which is worse, blind and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious Popery. And they have no lesse observed the progresse of wicked cruelty among the Cavali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and from their bloudy designes against the Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aments Forces, have instructed themselves how they ought to be affected to such wicked Cavaliers, giving thereby example unto other Counties, to stand firm in their resolution for Religion and the Parliament.</p>
